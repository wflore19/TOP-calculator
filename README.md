1. Your calculator is going to contain functions for all of the basic math operators you typically find on simple calculators, so start by creating functions for the following items and testing them in your browserâ€™s console.
    a. add
    b. subtract
    c. multiply
    d. divide

input: keyboard, buttons
processor: functions, arrays
output: display
power source: my willingness to finish this project and not give up when I hit a wall and my ability to not get distracted

calculator logic:
1.button is pushed
2.figure out the value of the button that was pushed
3.display the value of the button that was pushed
4.if more buttons are pushed, add them on the display as well
5.continue doing this until an operator button is pressed
6.do something different
7.store the number on the display into a memory called register
8.wipe the display and wait for another button to be pushed
9.enter the second number as before
10.store new number into a new register
11.finally when you hit the '=' button, calculate the contents of the two registers and display the result

display logic:

numbers are just symbols
