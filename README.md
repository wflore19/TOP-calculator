power source: my willingness to finish this project and not give up when I hit a wall and my ability to not get distracted

calculator logic:
1.button is pushed
2.figure out the value of the button that was pushed
3.display the value of the button that was pushed
4.if more buttons are pushed, add them on the display as well
5.continue doing this until an operator button is pressed
6.operator button is pushed
7.store the number on the display into a memory called register
8.wipe the display and wait for another button to be pushed
9.enter the second number as before
10.store new number into a new register
11.finally when you hit the '=' button, calculate the contents of the two registers and display the result

numbers are just symbols

html elements are created using dom methods in .js file
'.' decimal button after used
